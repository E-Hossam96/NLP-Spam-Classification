Ukraine crisis: How changemakers step up. 

 

 

 

Dear Hossam,
       
Millions of people have fled from Ukraine. Mostly women and children in search of safety. 
They seek refuge in Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Moldova, Romania and increasingly 
across Europe and the world. Whether it is war or Covid-19, times of crisis make critical 
challenges more visible – be it violence against women, restrictive gender norms, or 
xenophobia.

For more than 20 years, Ashoka Fellow Agata Teutsch has been addressing these 
challenges by building networks of women in Poland and Eastern Europe which 
mainstream anti-discrimination guidelines and practices across schools, workplaces and 
communities. Join us on May 25, as we explore with her how Fundacja Autonomia has 
been responding to the Ukrainian refugee crisis and Covid-19, and the role we can all 
play to ensure girls grow up to be changemakers.
